Design Principles
-----------------
This DSL was constructed following key design principles to ensure simplicity, flexibility, and reusability:

1. **Functional and Type-Based Design:** No custom classes; simple data structures like grids (vector of vectors of integers) and objects (sets of cells represented as tuples of color and location) are used.

2. **Abstract and Generic Functions:** Functions are written to abstract away details and work across types (e.g., grids and objects), with minimal DSL primitives specific to rare cases.

3. **Simple Function Signatures:** Functions have small argument lists and always return a single entity, promoting clarity and ease of use.

4. **Limited and Simple Types:** Only a small set of types is used (e.g., "grid", "object", "integer") to keep the DSL consistent and easy to learn.

5. **Reducing Redundancy:** DSL components that could be composed from others were avoided unless they were frequently used, leading to concise yet powerful primitives.

6. **Pruning and Expanding Components:** 
   - **Removing** underused, overly complex, or redundant components.
   - **Adding** components that simplify frequent tasks or enable significantly shorter solvers.
